# CV based on JSON.resume and theme based on [jsonresume-theme-fresh by Tair Assimov](https://github.com/assimovt/jsonresume-theme-fresh/blob/master/README.md) and [JSON Resume](http://jsonresume.org/)

This project's purpose is to enable me to maintain my CV and keep it under version control.

I've modified the theme to accommodate my needs (extra fields, languages).
